# Nermal Neural Network

I named my project Nermal because I like Garfield and it sounded a little like neural.

This project is my attempt to understand how neural networks work. I started with a book from Tariq Rashid. His Github repository can be found here [makeyourownneuralnetwork](https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetwork). And his book is Make Your Own Neural Network. I enjoyed it and would recommend.

I went through his examples and developed a neural network in Python. But then converted the project to C++ using Eigen. And then implemented a small UI to help demonstrate how the neural network is trained and how it makes predictions.

Training data comes from [mnist](https://github.com/phoebetronic/mnist).

I used copilot / Claude Sonnet to help convert from python and to help build the UI. 

It was a fun little project.
